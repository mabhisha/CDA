Crime Data Analytic (Data Science Project)
We have successfully completed a Data Science and Data Visualization project capable of analyzing and predicting any 
dataset that meets the required attributes. Specifically, we have developed an easily accessible model that analyzes and 
predicts the severity of crimes based on the type and number of crimes that have occurred in a given location. This model 
provides assistance to both the general public and law enforcement agencies, enabling them to take necessary 
actions.
